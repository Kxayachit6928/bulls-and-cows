print(""" In this game The first player is the Zoo keeper. 
They secretly choose a three digit number using the numbers zero to 9 with no duplicates. 
The second player, the Visitor, gets 10 tries to guess the secret number. After each guess, the Zoo keeper ‚Äúscores‚Äù using the following code:

Lizards: 	One digit in your guess is correct and in the correct position of the secret code. 
Geckos:	    One digit of your guess is present in the secret code, but in the wrong position. If you get three Geckos, your guess has all the correct digits, but all in the wrong place!
Mice:	    None of the digits in your guess are in the secret code. 

You'll only get 10 attempts and if you don't get it in those 10 guesses you'll lose!
